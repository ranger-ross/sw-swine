Buckshot,buckshot.jpg,This guy was special from little on and just kept getting better and better. His grandmother was our best Willis show and has produced many great daughters for us. Owned with Scott Sullivan. We have had as many positive comments from our customer that have used him than on any other Berk boar weâ€™ve ever had. His babies are awesome and easy to sell and continue to get better as they grow. The list of champions out of him just keeps growing! REG#145928005,http://realhogfarms.com/boars/berkshire/
I Do 2,ido2.jpg,Doug Albrights popular class winning boar at Belton 2017. I Do 2 was our choice out of a deep set of boars at the Southwest Conference. From the ground up^ he is big footed^ even toed and stout structured. He has that special look from the side and combines that with an expressive top. He is exceptionally good on the move. Owned with Sullivan.  REG#142599004,http://realhogfarms.com/boars/berkshire/
